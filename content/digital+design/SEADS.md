I joined SEADS in 2019 - they are a collective of artists, scientists, engineers and activists from around the world. SEADS is actively engaged in deconstructing dominant paradigms about the future and finding alternative models through inquiry and hands-on experimentation. 
The Biomodd installations are the foundation of SEADS work, where recycled technology coexist and interact with living ecosystems. Typically, the more audiences use the technology, the more heat, light and water are supplied to the ecosystems. The process and build of these projects are developed on site with local communities, aiming to start conversations about ecology, progress and consumer culture.
