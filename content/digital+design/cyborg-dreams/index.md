2018, Barbican Centre and Old Street Roundabout

Working with digital artist Antonio Roberts over a number of months, I created a series of self-portraits working with glitch and projection mapping techniques. The series was exhibited at the Barbican Centre and the films were subsequently displayed on Old Street Roundabout in the Summer.
