In 2021 and 2022 I was selected as a lead artist on the Rivers of the World Programme, in partnership with Metal Liverpool, Totally Thames Festival and the British Council. I worked with students across Liverpool to respond to the River Mersey and wider ideas around rivers through a global lens. Through this process we co-created artworks using different techniques such as willow weaving, hand-sewing, assemblage and illustration. I then brought all these individual works together into one digital piece which have been exhibited in Liverpool, London and abroad.
