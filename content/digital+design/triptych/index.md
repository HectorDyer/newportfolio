Made in collaboration with Freyja Sewell and Louis Rutherford, Triptych looks to a future where humans, technology and nature come together. 
We view Triptych as a way to imagine sustainability and empowerment, presenting practical steps for everyone to take part. 
We believe in knowledge sharing, re-use and the healing power that nature can play in our mental and physical health. Typically we have worked across installation and performances.
