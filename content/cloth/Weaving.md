These are a selection of weaving pieces and samples I have created since October 2021 - Spring 2022. All were woven on handlooms, predominantly on a George Wood Dobby and Countermarch looms. My early works were mainly using cotton and wool yarns, with more recent pieces using nylons and rayons, as well as fancy yarns.
