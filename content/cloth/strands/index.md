2021 - ongoing

These woven pieces are in response to my research around Cranial Sacral Therapy and fascia - the interconnecting tissue under the skin which allows bones, muscles and fibres to move. The fascia moves on its own accord, like a matrix of the nervous system. It is also the site where stress, trauma and tension gets stored within the body. 
I think of this with the process of weaving, intersecting one thread with another. The systems that are created through this. And what happens when these threads are broken, frayed or placed under too much tension.
