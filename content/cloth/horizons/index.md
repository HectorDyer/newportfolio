This series was commissioned for 'Splitting the Atom', curated by Ele Carpenter. I used natural dyeing and cyanotype techniques to create cloth that will gradually change colour over time. The works respond to the planned decommissioning of the Ignalina Power Plant, which the town was originally built around. 

Embroidered text:

"rising on the horizon, a gleaming tower above our city. 
'how long will it last?' ask young tongues. 
'as long as we need', we whisper, memories woven on every street. the tower pulses power day and night. 

"rising on the horizon, a spiky tower above ruins. 
'what is this place?' ask young tongues. 
'an old home', we whisper, walking on forgotten roads. 
the tower is empty, swaying on ghostly ground."
