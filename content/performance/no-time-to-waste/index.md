'Taffy the turtle was caught in plastic from a British supermarket. Taffy was washed up on the Thames bank, miles from home and very weak. 
Taffy will now make their final crawl. When Taffy can crawl no further, that will be that.
â€‹
Produced in partnership with Totally Thames Festival and National Maritime Museum, No Time to Waste was a processional performance. It lasted as long as the turtle could crawl. Anyone and everyone who wished to say goodbye to the turtle was invited to do so in the way they chose.
