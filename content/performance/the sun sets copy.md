Made in collaboration with Jemima Yong, this piece was commissioned by the Barbican Centre in response to the pandemic. We performed it when the UK government was announcing 'Operation Moonshot'. I was thinking about the vaccine race, international competition, the history of the space race...how some people want to plant a flag wherever they can. The piece was also a response to Barbican Stories, which recounted experiences of discrimination in the workplace and the colonialism that underpins these spaces. You can read more about our decision to remove this piece from the Barbicanâ€™s exhibition here.
