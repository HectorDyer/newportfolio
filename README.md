### Creating New Pages
Use the `model.md` as template for a single page.
Create it within the `/content` directory using the name of your choice.

### 
Images that render on single page gallery live within the content folder now.
Hugo adds every image that exists there.

eg. Every image within the `content/cloth/applique/` will render within the single page image gallery
